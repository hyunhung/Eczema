<h1>Causes</h1>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">
The specific cause of eczema remains unknown, but it is believed to develop due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Eczema is not contagious.<br>
Children are more likely to develop eczema if a parent has had the condition or another atopic disease.
If both parents have an atopic disease, the risk is even greater.

Environmental factors are also known to bring out the symptoms of eczema, such as:
<p style="margin-top:30px;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Irritants</strong> : These include soaps, detergents, shampoos, disinfectants, juices from fresh fruits, meats, or vegetables.</li>
<li><strong>Allergens</strong> : Dust mites, pets, pollens, mold, and dandruff can lead to eczema.</li>
<li><strong>Microbes</strong> : These include bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, viruses, and certain fungi.</li>
<li><strong>Hot and cold temperatures</strong> : Very hot or cold weather, high and low humidity, and perspiration from exercise can bring out eczema.</li>
<li><strong>Foods</strong> : Dairy products, eggs, nuts and seeds, soy products, and wheat can cause eczema flare-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Stress</strong> : This is not a direct cause of eczema but can make symptoms worse.</li>
<li><strong>Hormones</strong> : Women can experience increased eczema symptoms at times when their hormone levels are changing, for example during pregnancy and at certain points in the menstrual cycle.</li>
</ul>
