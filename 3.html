<h1>Treatment</h1>

<p style "margin-bottom:px30;">
There is no cure for eczema. Treatment for the condition aims to heal the affected skin and prevent flare-ups of symptoms. Doctors will suggest a plan of treatment based on an individual's age, symptoms, and current state of health.
For some people, eczema goes away over time. For others, it remains a lifelong condition.

<h2>Home care</h2>
<p>
There are <a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/atopic-dermatitis"target="_blank">numerous things</a>
that people with eczema can do to support skin health and alleviate symptoms, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>taking lukewarm baths</li>
<li>applying moisturizer within 3 minutes of bathing to "lock in" moisture</li>
<li>moisturizing every day</li>
<li>wearing cotton and soft fabrics, and avoiding rough, scratchy fibers and tight-fitting clothing</li>
<li>using a mild soap or a non-soap cleanser when washing</li>
<li>air drying or gently patting skin dry with a towel, rather than rubbing the skin dry after bathing</li>
<li>where possible, avoiding rapid changes of temperature and activities that make you sweat</li>
<li>learning and avoiding individual eczema triggers</li>
<li>using a humidifier in dry or cold weather</li>
<li>keeping fingernails short to prevent scratching from breaking the skin</li>
</ul>
<p style "margin-top:px30;">
  <h2>Medications</h2>
  There are several medications that doctors can prescribe to treat the symptoms of eczema, including:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments</strong> : These are a type of anti-inflammatory medication and should relieve the main symptoms of eczema, such as skin inflammation and itchiness.
    They are applied directly to the skin.</li>
<li><strong>Systemic corticosteroids</strong> : If topical treatments are not effective, systemic corticosteroids can be prescribed. These are either injected or taken by mouth, and they are only used for short periods of time.
</li>
<li><strong>Antihistamines</strong> : These reduce the risk of nighttime scratching as they can cause drowsiness.
<li><strong>Topical calcineurin inhibitors</strong> : This is a type of drug that suppresses the activities of the immune system. It decreases inflammation and helps prevent flare-ups.
<li><strong>Barrier repair moisturizers</strong> : These reduce water loss and work to repair the skin.
<li><strong>Phototherapy</strong> : This involves exposure to ultraviolet A or B waves, alone or combined. The skin will be monitored carefully. This method is normally used to treat moderate dermatitis.
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:30px margin-bottom:50px;">
Even though the condition itself is not yet curable, there should be a particular treatment plan to suit each person with different symptoms. Even after an area of skin has healed,
it is important to keep looking after it, as it may easily become irritated again.
