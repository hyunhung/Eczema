<h1>What is Eczema?</h1>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis" target="_blank"title="^___^"><strong> Eczema</strong></a> is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. Blisters may sometimes occur.
<br><br>
Different stages and types of eczema affect 31.6 percent of people in the United States.
The word "eczema" is also used specifically to talk about atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema.
"Atopic" refers to a collection of diseases involving the immune system, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and hay fever. Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin.
Some people outgrow the condition, while others will continue to have it throughout adulthood.
